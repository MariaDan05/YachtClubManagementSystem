# Yacht Club Management System

The yacht club “The jolly pirate” wants to have a management system that will help to keep track of all the internal processes. 
The system makes it easy for members to manage their boats and membership fee payments, see all the events and be an active part of a club. 
The secretaries have an opportunity to create those events and manage them.
